# Ansible-AWS Project: Automated Deployment of a Load-Balanced Web Application with MySQL

This project automates the deployment of a web application on AWS using Ansible. It provisions a MySQL database server, two Flask web servers, and an AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB) to distribute traffic. The setup includes dynamic inventory management, secure credential handling with Ansible Vault, and email notifications upon completionâ€”all orchestrated through Ansible playbooks.

## Project Overview

- **Infrastructure**:
  - 1 MySQL database server (`db-server`)
  - 2 Flask web servers (`web-server`)
  - 1 AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
- **Automation Goals**:
  - Provision EC2 instances
  - Configure security groups
  - Set up MySQL and Flask applications
  - Deploy the load balancer
  - Send deployment notifications
- **Security**:
  - Credentials encrypted with Ansible Vault
  - Minimal permissions via security groups
